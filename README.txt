These files put Monika into Super Deepthroat for you.  Yay!

Place the 'Monika' folder in the 'Mods' folder.  There is a file called 'CharacterFolders' in the Mods folder, open it in any text editor and add, "Monika:Monika" on a separate line.

The settings are all default except for Monika herself, you can feel free to edit them to suit you if you'd like.  In settings, under the 'Custom' tab, there's a box marked 'Dialogue Name'.  You can enter your name here, and she'll use it.

Please feel free to help me add more lines for her!  https://github.com/PrussianSpaceMarine/Monika-SDT/tree/master
